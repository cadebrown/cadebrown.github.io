# My Content

**Python and the infinite** _October 2020_ - [lwn.net/Articles/833624](https://lwn.net/Articles/833624)

: TL;DR: I made a post on `python-dev` about Python has some inconsistencies with how it handles math, and the story was picked up by LWN

**ORNL's SimpleSummit** _2018_ [youtube.com/watch?v=fIOulrWkljo](https://youtube.com/watch?v=fIOulrWkljo)

: "Cade Brown and Thomas Hill developed a small-scale demonstration unit of the Summit supercomputer called Simple Summit"

: (please excuse the music/audio quality, I was not the producer!)

# People

## Worked With

[Gregory Croisdale](https://gregory.croisdale.us/)

: A frequent collaborator, we've worked together on [Avocat](https://github.com/utk-pairs/avocat), [CARVE](https://carve.chemicaldevelopment.us/), and many, many, more

[Stan Tomov](http://www.icl.utk.edu/~tomov/)

: My research advisor for ~2 years at ICL, who researches linear algebra and GPU computing

[Paul Zimmerman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Zimmermann_(mathematician))

: MPFR author, also the author of Modern Computer Arithmetic (a very very useful book). Also part of the team that factored [RSA 240 and 250](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_Factoring_Challenge)


# Books

## Computer Science Books

[*The Art of Computer Programming*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming)

: Possibly the best book on computer science ever written, deals primarily with algorithms and their implementations

[*Modern Computer Arithmetic*](https://books.google.com/books/about/Modern_Computer_Arithmetic.html?id=-8wuH5AwbwMC&source=kp_book_description)

: A useful book for implementing bignum arithmetic, goes into many, many algorithms and special cases. Basically all you need to write your own MPFR/libbf/GMP library

[*Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Programming_in_the_Unix_Environment)

: Heavily recommended for C programming, teaches the C standard library for UNIX OSes


## Math Books

[*The Elements*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements)

: Written by Euclid around 300BC, this book is a good introduction to the basics of mathematics starting with the basics of geometry

: In my opinion, this should be the first mathematics textbook for schools to use. It's ridiculous that most schools to teach students geometry without using Euclid's work. 

[*Prime Numbers and the Riemann Hypothesis*](https://books.google.com/books/about/Prime_Numbers_and_the_Riemann_Hypothesis.html?id=jyU7rgEACAAJ)

: Very useful book, for people of all backgrounds (not just mathematicians) that explains prime numbers, number theory, and the Riemann Hypothesis. Gives multiple formulations, diagrams, and explanations. My favorite book on my favorite problem in all of mathematics (so far)!


# Papers

[*On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Magnitude*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Number_of_Primes_Less_Than_a_Given_Magnitude)

: Possibly the most influential (and yet still underrated) paper in all of mathematics, I highly recommend this paper. Check out [my blog post](/2020/08/05/diy-gamma-zeta) on the Gamma/Zeta function implementations

[*Design, Optimization, and Benchmarking of Dense Linear Algebra Algorithms on AMD GPUs*](https://www.icl.utk.edu/files/publications/2020/icl-utk-1405-2020.pdf)

: My paper, which discusses my work on porting and performance tuning the [MAGMA](https://icl.cs.utk.edu/magma/) library

[*Counterexample To Euler's Conjecture on Sums of Like Powers*](https://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1966-72-06/S0002-9904-1966-11654-3/S0002-9904-1966-11654-3.pdf)

: One of my favorite papers, although not particularly explanative. A computer-assisted dis-proof of one of Euler's conjectures
