2019-08 - [MAGMA (HIP port, optimization)](https://icl.cs.utk.edu/magma/)

  : I joined ICL (Innovative Computing Laboratory) and successfully MAGMA to HIP (i.e. so that it would work on AMD GPUs). We also did performance tuning (see my [first paper](https://www.icl.utk.edu/files/publications/2020/icl-utk-1415-2020.pdf), it's in this timeline)

  : for example, $ 36 x^2 + 558 x + 359 $ is prime for 30 consecutive values (starting at $0$)
<!--  : ($ 36*x^2 + 558*x + 359 $ )
