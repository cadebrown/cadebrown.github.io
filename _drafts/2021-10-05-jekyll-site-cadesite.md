Recently, I've been cleaning house on old projects and websites -- and I realized I wanted to get this blog going as a technical blog. What better way than by making a blog post about the blog itself? the full source code for my website is available at [cadebrown/cadebrown.github.io](https://github.com/cadebrown/cadebrown.github.io), and hosted at [cade.site](https://cade.site)

## Goal

the goal of this project is to have a clean, fast, and easy-to-modify blog that other people can use for theirs. this jekyll template has:

  * math formatting using [Katex](https://www.katex.org/) (i.e. `$...$` and `$$...$$`)
  * code syntax highlighting using [Prism](https://prismjs.com/)
    * also supports custom languages, plugins, and more... check it out!
  * (optional) Google Analytics support


TODO: explain how it works, how to modify, etc...
