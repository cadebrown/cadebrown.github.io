This is the first post in a long-overdue series: Software I Hate (SIH). For today's entry we have [Maxon](https://maxon.net), a 3D audio/video effects company.

## Main Issue: Billing

My main problem is not Maxon's effects, but their billing. I signed up for a "free" 6-month trial for students, with the reasonable expectation that I could cancel at any time.

My calendar reminder (set 6 months ago) just went off today, and I look up how to cancel my subscription (after futile attempts to find it from my account on Maxon's website):

However, if you follow their instructions, this is what you see:

And I know what you're thinking... Perhaps you should be able to click "Update quantity" and change to 0 (the default value that it is), effectively canceling your subscription, right? Well, you would be dead wrong:

If you go with the reasonable expectation that setting the quantity to `0` would cancel it, you get a nice `alert()` call in your browser:

Okay, what about the `cancel` button. Since it is different than the `close` button, it should cancel the subscription right? **dead wrong, again**. It simply does nothing and cancels the window, functionally equivalent to the `close` button.

I consider myself pretty technical but this is needlessly Kafkaesque. It feels like adversarial/hostile architecture meant to keep people frustrated and confused. 

This is just terrible experience, and instantly makes me never want to use any of Maxon's software again.
