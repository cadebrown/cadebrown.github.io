# Style

this page contains examples and explanations of my personal stylistic choices regarding communication, speaking, and design. my hope is that it makes my communications easy to understand, parse, and scan quickly to get important information (even for non-native English readers)

if you notice a grammar "mistake" that doesn't hamper your understanding (such as starting a sentence with a lowercase letter), just know **it was probably intentional** ([remember, language is subjective and invented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_language))

## Pronouns

I usually go by `they/them` or `he/him`, but it really doesn't matter. when referring to me, use whatever is easiest for you

in general, I try to use `they/them` and gender-agnostic language when referring to someone I don't know personally or that goes by those pronouns. I have mixed thoughts on using `xe/xim`/`ze/zim` as default pronouns (since most people would be confused if they heard it applied to them), so I try to use `they/them` unless the specific person uses `xe/xim`

things get complicated when you consider:

  * some people wish to be called by gender-specific pronouns (i.e. `they/them` is not good enough)
  * some cases in which gender-specific pronouns may aid comprehension or shorten  (i.e. `Steve (he/his) gave Elisha (she/her) a new phone. she sent it back to him because it broke`)
    * if my audience doesn't know who I am referring to, I use parentheticals containing the pronouns directly after each person's name

here are some other guidelines I try to follow:

  * avoid gender-specific language in negative contexts especially (a good rule of thumb: replace the gender with a race/ethnicity and see if the phrase is still okay)
    * identifying someone as "that guy who did a really bad thing" or "that girl who did a really bad thing" is uneccessary

## Capitalization

I normally start sentences with lowercase letters, except when:

  * the first word is a proper noun (or should be capitalized due to being an acronym)
  * the sentence is a title/section header (I consider those to be proper nouns, as they name specific objects/places)

it's not standard English, but here's why I don't follow the standard convention of capitalization:
 
  * it's unecessary, as there are already indications where sentences start (i.e. its the first text you see, or following a punctuation mark, or a UI element)
  * it's ugly, as most letters are lowercase
  * I can't tell at a quick glance whether a word is a proper noun or just the start of a sentence
  * it's slower to type, requiring `Shift` key input which takes my fingers away

when using proper nouns, I try to respect the authors' wishes with capitalization (with limits, of course)

## Quotations

I use either `'` or `"` to begin and end quotations. if I'm quoting code or something digital, I use backticks (`` ` ``) which will render them as `monospace font` on most computers (along with different styling)

I follow [Wikipedia's quotation+punctuation guide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style/quotation_and_punctuation#Quotation_marks_and_punctuation). US English is just wrong... if the punctuation is not part of the quotation, it should not be inside of the quotation marks!


## Punctuation

### Octothorpe

I call the [`#` symbol an octothorpe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign). I remember it because there's 8 little thorns, so it's like "eight-thorns" to "octo-thorpe"

in the US, it is referred to as a "pound sign"... but this can be very confusing considering [that's already used for something else](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sign)
